Sparse-view Reconstruction can be used to provide accelerated low dose CT imaging with both 
accelerated scan and reduced projection/back-projection calculation.Despite the rapid developments, 
image noise and artifacts still remain a major issue in the low dose protocol. In this paper, 
a deep learning based method named Improved GoogLeNet is proposed to remove streak artifacts 
due to projection missing in sparse-view CT reconstruction.Residual learning is used in GoogLeNet 
to study the artifacts of sparse-view CT reconstruction, and then subtracts the artifacts obtained 
by learning from the sparse reconstructed images, finally recovers a clear correction image.
The intensity of reconstruction using the proposed method is very close to the full-view projective 
reconstructed image. The results indicate that the proposed method is practical and effective for 
reducing the artifacts and preserving the quality of the reconstructed image.
